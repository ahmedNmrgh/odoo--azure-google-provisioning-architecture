# odoo--azure-google-provisioning-architecture
This project aims to make Odoo the single source of truth for user management and automatically synchronize user changes (creation, updates, deactivation) to Microsoft Entra ID and Google Workspace.  Instead of manually creating and managing users across multiple platforms, all user lifecycle actions are performed once in Odoo and then propagated automatically to identity providers.


this project is an issue I have talked about with my interviewer in one of my job interviews , I have took a simple look on it to figgure why this is an issue but i couldn't stop thinking abt it now I'm simply enjoying it , and since I'm preping for az-305 solution architect , this seemed to be a good opurtunity to design this and implement it if I get the job ofc >_<.
